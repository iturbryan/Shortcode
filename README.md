Shortcode

Shortcode is a web application to assist developers in fast delivery of shortcode applications. It's engineered in Codeigniter & Twitter Bootstrap and MySQL database engine.
It's designed and tested for Africas Talking SMS Gateway (Kenya), but I guess with a little tweaking, should work with other gateways as well.

Directory Structure

- application - holds all the core application files e.g. models, views and controllers
- database - has the applications database
- media - all the extended resources are in this folder; js, css and fonts
- system - please do not touch anything in this folder unless you know what you are doing (i mean it).

Well, that's it folk, you gonna need to have worked with CodeIgniter to proceed from here. Good luck.
