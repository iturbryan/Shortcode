Shortcode

Shortcode is a web application to assist developers in fast delivery of shortcode applications. It's engineered in Codeigniter & Twitter Bootstrap.
It's designed and tested for Africas Talking SMS Gateway (Kenya), but I guess with a little tweaking, should work with other gateways as well.
